I have started to learn Python a few days ago. This is my first ever Python project.
This is a typical Alien Invasion game. Where player shoots down alien spaceship.
A player is given three life.
Current score along with highest score is shown in display.
Highest score is also stored in a text file and game loads the previous record at the start of the game.
